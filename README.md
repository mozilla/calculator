##Dev notes##
If you plan to create, update, or destroy any files, please make sure to update the zip.

```shell
zip app/application.zip newfile.whatever # add a new file into the zip
zip -f app/applicaton.zip # Rezip modified contents aka freshen
zip -d app/application.zip garbage.whatever # remove a file from the zip
```

Note: updating the zip is unnecessary if you're developing with the
[Firefox OS Simulator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Firefox_OS_Simulator)
(Recommended).  With the simulator, you can
install as a packaged app by clicking Add Directory, then browsing to the
manifest.webapp.
